# Object-Detection
Object detection using  Machine learning(Image AI) to label ,annotate and score objects  in images and videos.We use Image AI built by Moses Olafenwa and John Olafenwa brothers, creators of TorchFusion and Authors of Introduction to Deep Computer Vision

ImageAI supports a list of state-of-the-art Machine Learning algorithms for image prediction, custom image prediction, object detection, video detection, video object tracking and image predictions trainings. ImageAI currently supports image prediction and training using 4 different Machine Learning algorithms trained on the ImageNet-1000 dataset. ImageAI also supports object detection, video detection and object tracking using RetinaNet, YOLOv3 and TinyYOLOv3 trained on COCO dataset. 
Eventually, ImageAI will provide support for a wider and more specialized aspects of Computer Vision including and not limited to image recognition in special environments and special fields.

ImageAI provides classes and methods for you to run image prediction your own custom objects using your own model trained with ImageAI Model Training class. You can use your custom models trained with SqueezeNet, ResNet50, InceptionV3 and DenseNet and the JSON file containing the mapping of the custom object names.

ImageAI uses the Tensorflow backbone for it's Computer Vision operations. Tensorflow supports both CPUs and GPUs ( Specifically NVIDIA GPUs. You can get one for your PC or get a PC that has one) for machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms' implementations. 

Currently, we are using Image AI(A python library built to empower developers to build applications and systems with self-contained Deep Learning and Computer Vision capabilities using simple and few lines of code) to track objects and score onto sports platform.
